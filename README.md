# Relic - Artifact Storage Service

A modern, feature-rich artifact service with immutable relics, complete version history, and smart content processing. Built with FastAPI (Python), Svelte, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

Relic is a self-hosted pastebin and artifact storage system designed for developers. It goes beyond simple text storage by supporting binary files, archives, images, and providing rich previews for various content types. With a focus on immutability and versioning, Relic ensures your shared snippets and files are safe, trackable, and easy to manage.

## Key Features

- **Immutable Artifacts**: Each relic is permanent. Edits create new versions via forking with complete history preserved.
- **Universal Content Support**: 
  - **Code**: Syntax highlighting for 100+ languages.
  - **Images**: Preview and zoom support.
  - **Archives**: Browse ZIP/TAR contents directly in the browser.
  - **Documents**: PDF rendering, CSV/Excel tables, and Markdown rendering.
  - **Diagrams**: Integrated Excalidraw support.
- **CLI Tool**: Powerful command-line interface for quick uploads from terminal.
- **Relic Indexes**: Create curated collections of relics (`.rix` files).
- **Access Control**: Public, unlisted, and private relics.
- **Expiration**: Set relics to expire after 1h, 24h, 7d, 30d, or never.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage users, view system stats, and moderate content.

## CLI Tool

Relic comes with a powerful CLI tool for terminal-based workflows.

### Quick Install
```bash
curl -sSL https://your-domain.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Usage
```bash
# Upload from stdin
echo "Hello World" | relic

# Upload a file
relic myfile.txt

# Upload with options
relic --name "My Script" --private --expires 24h script.py
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make (optional, but recommended)

### Production Deployment (Recommended)

For production/release deployments, use the default configuration:

1. **Start production services**
```bash
make up
```

Or without Make:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

2. **Access the application**
- Application: http://localhost
- MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)

3. **View logs**
```bash
make logs
```

4. **Stop services**
```bash
make down
```

### Development Setup

For local development with hot-reload:

1. **Start development services**
```bash
make dev-up
```

Or without Make:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

2. **Access the application**
- Frontend: http://localhost (with hot-reload)
- Backend: http://localhost/api (with auto-reload)
- API Docs: http://localhost/api/docs
- MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)

3. **View logs**
```bash
make dev-logs
```

4. **Stop services**
```bash
make dev-down
```

**Note:** Development mode mounts your local code directories as volumes, enabling hot-reload for both frontend and backend. Changes to code will be reflected immediately without rebuilding.

## Admin Setup

Relic supports admin users with elevated privileges (view all relics, delete any relic, manage clients, view statistics).

### Setting Up an Admin User

1. **Get your Client ID**

   Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and run this in the Console:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.getItem('relic_client_key')
   ```

   This will output your client ID, which looks like: `5cdb7b79c38385db9f5b5f6ad884c8ef`

2. **Configure Admin in Production**

   Edit `docker-compose.prod.yml` and set the `ADMIN_CLIENT_IDS` environment variable:
   ```yaml
   backend:
     environment:
       ADMIN_CLIENT_IDS: "5cdb7b79c38385db9f5b5f6ad884c8ef"
   ```

   For multiple admins, use comma-separated values:
   ```yaml
   ADMIN_CLIENT_IDS: "5cdb7b79c38385db9f5b5f6ad884c8ef,a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678abcdef01"
   ```

3. **Restart Services**
   ```bash
   make down
   make up
   ```

4. **Access Admin Panel**

   After restarting, the "Admin" tab will appear in the navigation. Admin privileges include:
   - View all relics (including private ones)
   - Delete any relic (not just your own)
   - View all registered clients
   - Delete clients and their relics
   - View system statistics

### Development Environment

For development mode, edit `docker-compose.dev.yml` instead and use:
```bash
make dev-down
make dev-up
```

## Relic Indexes

Relic indexes (`.rix` files) allow you to create curated collections of relics.

```yaml
title: My Project Documentation
description: A collection of documentation files.
relics:
  - id: f47ac10b58cc4372a5670e02b2c3d479
    title: API Reference
  - id: a1b2c3d4e5f678901234567890abcdef
```

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

**Create Relic**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/v1/relics \
  -F "file=@myfile.txt" \
  -F "name=My File"
```

**Get Relic**
```bash
curl http://localhost/api/v1/relics/{id}
```

**Fork Relic**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/v1/relics/{id}/fork \
  -F "file=@new.txt"
```

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Svelte, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pygments
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (Metadata), MinIO (Content)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Nginx
