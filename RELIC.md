# RelicBin Feature Specification

## Overview

Modern artifacts service with immutable artifacts, version lineage tracking, and rich file processing. Users can share text, code, images, documents, and any binary content. Each relic is permanent with a unique URL. Edits create new relics linked to the original.

## Core Features

### 1. Immutable Relics

**Concept:**
- Relics cannot be edited after creation
- Each relic has a unique ID and permanent URL
- "Editing" creates a new relic linked to the original
- Complete version history preserved through parent-child relationships

**Example:**
```
Original relic:  f47ac10b58cc4372a5670e02b2c3d479  → /f47ac10b58cc4372a5670e02b2c3d479
User edits:      a1b2c3d4e5f678901234567890abcdef  → /a1b2c3d4e5f678901234567890abcdef  (parent: f47ac...)
User edits:      1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef  → /1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef  (parent: a1b2c...)

All three URLs remain accessible
Lineage tracked: f47ac... → a1b2c... → 12345...
```

### 2. Version Lineage Tracking

**Version Chain:**
- Each relic knows its parent (previous version)
- Each relic knows its root (original in chain)
- Sequential version numbers (1, 2, 3...)
- Full history queryable

**Fork Support:**
- Users can fork any relic to start new lineage
- Fork creates independent version chain
- Original lineage preserved
- Attribution tracked via `fork_of` field


### 3. Universal Content Support

**Supported Types:**
- Text files (plain text, logs, configs)
- Source code (500+ languages)
- Images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
- Documents (PDF, Office files)
- Data files (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML)
- Videos (MP4, WebM, AVI)
- Audio (MP3, WAV, OGG)
- Archives (ZIP, TAR, 7Z)
- Binary files (any content type)

**All content types are:**
- Versionable (can be edited → new relic)
- Diffable (text) or comparable (binary)
- Processable (smart previews based on type)

### 4. Smart File Processing

- Progressive batch loading
- Full search and pagination
- YAML or simple list format

### 5. Relic Indexes

**Concept:**
Relic indexes are special files (`.rix` extension) that define collections of relics. They allow users to create curated lists with custom metadata, similar to playlists or reading lists.

**File Format:**
- MIME type: `application/x-relic-index`
- Extension: `.rix`
- Content: YAML or plain text

**Structured Format (YAML):**
```yaml
title: Collection Title
description: Optional description of this collection
relics:
  - id: f47ac10b58cc4372a5670e02b2c3d479
    title: Optional title override
    description: Optional description override
    tags: [tag1, tag2]
  - id: a1b2c3d4e5f678901234567890abcdef
  - id: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

**Simple Format (plain list):**
```
f47ac10b58cc4372a5670e02b2c3d479
a1b2c3d4e5f678901234567890abcdef
1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

**Processing:**
- Auto-detect format (structured vs simple)
- Extract relic IDs using regex pattern: `[a-f0-9]{32}`
- Parse metadata overrides (title, description, tags)
- Fetch each relic in batches (5 at a time)
- Apply overrides to fetched relic data
- Display in table with full functionality

**UI Features:**
- Progressive loading with progress indicator
- Full search and pagination support
- All standard relic actions (share, copy, download, fork)
- Error handling for missing/invalid relics
- Responsive table layout

**Use Cases:**
- Project documentation collections
- Code snippet libraries
- Tutorial series
- Resource lists
- Bookmarked favorites with notes

### 6. Diff & Comparison

**Text Content:**
- Unified diff format
- Line-by-line comparison
- Additions/deletions highlighted
- Syntax-highlighted diffs for code
- Show stats: +N lines, -N lines

**Binary Content:**
- Metadata comparison (size, dimensions)
- Cannot show line-by-line diff
- Visual side-by-side for images (optional)

**Diff Endpoints:**
- Compare any two relics
- Compare relic with its parent

   → Relic a3Bk9Zx created

2. View relic
   GET /a3Bk9Zx
   → Shows content with syntax highlighting

3. User wants to fix typo
   POST /api/relics/a3Bk9Zx/edit {content: "hello world"}
   → New relic b4Ck2Ty created (parent: a3Bk9Zx)

4. Both URLs still work
   GET /a3Bk9Zx → original version
   GET /b4Ck2Ty → edited version

5. View history
   GET /api/relics/b4Ck2Ty/history

   → Returns: {
       rows: 1500,
       columns: ["id", "name", "value"],
       preview: [{id: 1, name: "foo", value: 100}, ...],
       stats: {value: {mean: 150, min: 10, max: 500}}
     }
```

### Workflow 5: Code Collaboration

```
1. Developer shares code
